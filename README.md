# Greenpeace Planet 4 Australia Pacific Theme

Planet 4 child theme for Australia Pacific. The related master themeâ€™s code lives at:

https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-master-theme.

Please check the master theme code for more information. 

## Installation

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- python3
- [python-setuptools](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/python-setuptools)

Also, ensure that you've run `npm run env:install` to get the SCSS files required
in the master theme, as we rely on some of the SCSS variables in our theme.

## Releases & Deploymentk

Currently, our deployment pipeline only matches tags which look like `v1.*` so
if we ever upgrade to v2+ then we will need to edit that [here](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-australiapacific/blob/main/production.json).
